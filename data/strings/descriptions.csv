# Ships,,,,,
lks_phylia,SHIP,"A light, nimble frigate, with middling yet adequate firepower. Phylia is more suited for reconnaisance than actual combat. However, it is capable of quick bursts of speed and firepower to surprise complacent attackers.
 
One of Lakhesis' first designs, the Phylia is intended for quick objective capture and harrassment, as evidenced by its light yet noticeable weapons setup, and its agility. It is one of the first implementations of the Monarchy's chrono-tech, utilizing a drive engine capable of increasing the ship's engine power, while also causing a time dilation effect. This causes the ship to be able to put more numerous ordnance downrange while evading enemy weapons fire. However, this also brings the adverse effects of time dilation with it. ",,,
lks_varynn,SHIP,"A heavier frigate more suited to ship-to-ship combat. This frigate is capable of weathering firepower while being able to flank heavier ships. However, it is vulnerable to missiles and strikecraft due to its minimal point-defense capabilities.

While Phylia is the light, agile frigate, the Varynn is the former's more powerful cousin, being able to go toe-to-toe with other frigates and possibly win. Utilizing the same drive engine as the Phylia, while fielding heavier armament, this frigate can even overwhelm larger ships in the right conditions. This makes it a force to be reckoned with, if the opposing fleet captain wishes to keep their more vulnerable ships intact.",,,
lks_phyriss,SHIP,"Basically a larger Phylia, the Phyriss carries middling firepower for a destroyer, but its agility allows it to outmaneuver and potentially bait larger ships to heavier allies. It is however, quite a menace to lighter ships due to its firepower and agility.

The Phyriss is a heavier implementation of the Phylia's  principles, utilizing a heavier Temporal Drive capable of storing more charges. This, along with powerful engines turns it into an able chaser capable of hunting frigates and possibly even outmaneuver them. Like its smaller cousin, it is also able to harrass larger ships with its agility.
",,,
lks_valys,SHIP,"While the lighter, faster ships capture objectives, the Valys is one of the ships to hold them. Adequate firepower and toughness makes it a good foundation for a battleline.  The power is amplified by its shipsystem, making it able to absorb weathering fire.

While the lighter ships are able to quickly capture objectives, the objectives need to be defended. The Monarchy knew this, and designed a defensive implementation of their chrono-tech. By modifying the Temporal Drive to instead strengthen shields and absorb damage, and installing it to a heavier frame, the Valys is born. While primarily defensive, the system can also be used offensively to overwhelm other ships in a duel while softening their blows.",,,
lks_shalys,SHIP,"A light carrier with even lighter armament, the Shalys' power lies in its fighter craft, and its shipsystem to amplify the former. Without both, it is helpless even against some frigates, relegating it to the backline.

A fleet needs a strikecraft complement, and the Shalys is one of the first to provide it for Lakhesis. With standard bays for a destroyer carrier, something is needed to reinforce its ability and offset its weak self-defense capabilities. Another version of the chrono-tech is needed, this time for fighters. Using the Temporal Barrier as a base, work began on a specialized barrier for fighters. The drive's power is diverted from the ship onto the fighters, enhancing their capabilities instead. With this, bombers can survive better and deliver their payload quicker, while fighters and interceptors can have an edge in dogfighting.",,,
lks_phylas,SHIP,"A light cruiser, with capable firepower for its class. The Phylas is able of filling the role of close support or hunter-killer. Oppressive against weaker opponents, while being able of limited line duty.

With both power and agility, the Phylas can somewhat reinforce a battleline, or reinforce the initial capturing party. With an even more powerful Temporal Drive, it can quickly exploit distractions made by tougher line ships, and suprise the distracted enemy captain with its ordnance. Although, if there are no line ships, it can hold its own, even if it crumbles quickly under extended pressure.",,,
lks_valyra,SHIP,"A cruiser sitting in the middle between the lighter Phylas and the heavier Valeryn. The Valyra bears heavier firepower than its lighter counterpart while being cheaper to deploy than its heavier counterpart, making it a good yet cheaper alternative to bolster a battleline.

The Monarchy needed a cruiser to bolster the battleline while awaiting heavier ships, and efforts were undertaken to design a ship to bridge the gap between Phylas and Valeryn. The ship was design to be more on the defensive side, utilizing Temporal Barrier and moderately heavy weaponry. It is also designed to be cheaper to deploy, causing it to be lighter and less tough. Nevertheless, it is adept at defending the line, while being cheaper to deploy than the heavier ships.",,,
lks_valeryn,SHIP,"A tough heavy cruiser with a powerful frontal firepower, the Valeryn is heavy, imposing, and slow. With the right conditions, this ship might even punch up to targets larger than itself.",,,
lks_sharynn,SHIP,"A cruiser carrier boasting capital-grade fighter power, the Sharynn is capable of enormous power projection for its size. However, like the Shalys, it is lightly armed, and is vulnerable to a dedicated flanker.",,,
lks_phyran,SHIP,"A battlecruiser with powerful frontal firepower, the Phyran is a menace to lighter ships. However, captains of larger ships shouldn't be complacent, lest they get blindsided by the Phyran's batteries in a fierce firefight. ",,,
lks_varhla,SHIP,"A battleship with powerful armament and wide weapon coverage, the Varhla is tough, powerful, and intimidating. Capable of duelling against other capital ships, it is a force to be reckoned with.",,,
lks_shalynn,SHIP,"A fleetcarrier with great number of fighter bays and adequate supportive firepower, the Shalynn is capable of enormous power projection. With the Remote Temporal Barrier, the already powerful 6 bays can potentially be deadly for an enemy ship or fighter squadron.",,,
lks_arathan,SHIP,"A massive ship, with a terrifying amount of weaponry, and extremely tough armor. This ship is piloted by an instance of The Arbiter, one of Lakhesis' monarch. It is designed for superiority in the battlespace, capable of potentially slaughter entire fleets on its own. This ship, along with a massive fleet, stands guard in the Lakhesis system, awaiting to unleash its fury upon any unfortunate interloper.",,,

#Planets,,,,,
planet_arynha,CUSTOM,"The capital and breadbasket of Lakhesis, this planet is ruled by the Nurturer, one of Lakhesis' AI monarchs. Here, the people live in comfort, since the more unpleasant industries has been relegated to other planets. However, this doesn't mean it is defenseless, as the surface is dotted with surface batteries protecting the planet's cities. ",,,
planet_ilryan,CUSTOM,"The heart of industry, defense, and personal abode of the Arbiter, this planet is extremely defended, its factories churning out hulls to defend the Monarchy's sovereignty. The surface is even worse, filled with numerous spires dotted with surface batteries. Those that live here are trained to be soldiers from birth, filled with combat implants and engineered for war.",,,

lakhesismonarchy,FACTION,"The Lakhesis Monarchy is a relatively powerful and prosperous polity in the Sector, based on the star system of Lakhesis. Although powerful, it doesn't dabble much in the Sector's internal politics, preferring to focus on its own affairs and self-improvement. Although the Monarchy hasn't shown signs of open hostility, the Hegemony and Luddic Church is concerned due to a simple fact: the Monarchy is ruled by AI, two, even.
The two ruling monarchs are referred to as the Nurturer and the Arbiter, due to their different attitudes. The Nurturer is kind and loving, she appreciates and holds life in a very high regard, while the Arbiter is cold and stalwart, prioritizing strength and skill, in order to defend the Monarchy. This difference in attitudes is reflected in the planets they rule, the terran world of Arynha is a pleasant place to live in, while the industry world of Ilryan is a supremely defended fortress.
The Monarchy places excellence above all else, due to the numerous threats that might appear, from Luddic zealots, to a potential Hegemony invasion. Although it desires peaceful unity with other polities, it also has to prepare for the worst. This leads the Monarchy to adopt methods that might be considered horrific to other polities, one of which is their engineered population growth program, where genetically-engineered babies are quickly grown to maturity, before fitted with implants to increase performance. Their brains are also implanted with information, allowing them to be productive right away. However, the Monarchy sees this as a necessary action to bolster its power.
The Monarchy wasn't always this way, however. It was a simple Domain vassal state with human administrators, albeit with hidden AI influence. It managed to appease the Domain of Man with tithes enough to be quietly ignored, avoiding the same fate as those openly defiant to the Domain, while slowly achieving self-sufficiency. When the Collapse occurred, the human administrators were overwhelmed, and in a strange deviation of human behavior, decided to prioritize the polity's survival instead of power, and surrendered control to two Alpha+ AI that would eventually be the Nurturer and Arbiter. The two AI immediately went to work, focusing the polity's efforts into self-sufficiency and bolstering the military, anticipating the incoming chaos, while also imposing isolation. Understandably some citizens rejected the rule of AI, but seeing the apparent benefits, and the AI rulers' genuine interest in keeping the polity afloat, they too eventually accepted the rule. Overtime, a sense of devotion developed within the citizens, unwilling to part with such a competent government, they became fiercely loyal, and when the monarchs began their transhumanist initiatives, the citizens readily accepted, some seeking for a way to serve better, some seeking purpose within their society. Enhancements became more intricate, and when Lakhesis finally ended its period of isolation, it has become a radically different polity than its Pre-Collapse counterpart.",,,
